# Hypothesis-Testing-Credit-Card
Business Problem Statement:
Context:
AtliQo Bank, a new entrant in the Indian banking sector, plans to launch a credit card product amidst fierce competition from established players like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and HDFC Bank. These legacy banks already have extensive market share, brand recognition, and diversified credit card offerings tailored to various customer segments.

Business Problem:
To successfully penetrate the Indian credit card market and attract new customers, AtliQo Bank needs to identify the most promising target segments and tailor its credit card offering accordingly. This requires a detailed analysis of demographic, occupational, income-based, and behavioral (payment method) data to uncover gaps and opportunities in the market.

Key Questions to Address:

Which age groups are most likely to adopt new credit cards?

What job types or professions have higher credit card usage or unmet credit needs?

Which income brackets are underserved or overserved by existing credit card providers?

How do payment behaviors vary across age and income segments (e.g., UPI, credit, debit, EMI)?

What are the strengths and weaknesses of competitors' current credit card offerings?

Objective:
To design a data-driven go-to-market strategy for AtliQo Bankâ€™s new credit card by identifying and prioritizing customer segments based on their likelihood to adopt a new credit product and by understanding competitor positioning in those segments.
